# **TEMPERATURE MONITORING SYSTEM**

## **project explaination**

One of the first things you do when getting into a vehicle is to adjust the temperature. You want the environment in the automobile to be precisely how you like it, whether it's too hot or too cold outside. We have employed a sensor in the proposed project to detect if the driver is seated or not, and if he is, the temperature must be adjusted accordingly. Our controller will adjust the heater to the proper temperature based on this information. Heat will be generated by the heater, and the temperature will be displayed on an uart display. The ATmega328 microcontroller, as well as switch pins, LEDs, and a UART display, were used in this project.
