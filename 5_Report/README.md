# **TEMPERATURE MONITORING SYSTEM**

## **Introduction**

One of the first things you do when getting into a vehicle is to adjust the temperature. You want the environment in the automobile to be precisely how you like it, whether it's too hot or too cold outside. We have employed a sensor in the proposed project to detect if the driver is seated or not, and if he is, the temperature must be adjusted accordingly. Our controller will adjust the heater to the proper temperature based on this information. Heat will be generated by the heater, and the temperature will be displayed on an uart display. The ATmega328 microcontroller, as well as switch pins, LEDs, and a UART display, were used in this project.

## **Features**

The system will detect whether or not the driver is sitting.
The temperature can be adjusted by the driver
and the heater will provide heat in accordance with the driver's needs.
System with a low cost

## **SWOT- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities Threats**

### **Strengths**

Inside the automobiles, the temperature may easily be changed.
System with a low cost.

### **Weakness**

It is only relevant in countries where the temperature is below freezing.

### **Opportunities**

It can be done if you have both a heater and an air conditioner.

### **Threats**

Not suitable for average or high temperature places.

## **4W's and 1'H**
